# Billions UI Challenge

This project aims to recreate the UI of the TV show "Billions" using SwiftUI, demonstrating proficiency in UI design and development using SwiftUI.

**Features:**

* Displays show details, including title, rating, and description.
* Allows users to select and view different seasons.
* Lists episodes within each season with their titles and episode numbers.
* Provides options to play or download episodes.
* Enables users to add episodes to a watchlist.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on a simulator or device.

**Known Issues:**

Image Loading: Images are currently not loading due to the absence of a base path for image URLs. This issue will be resolved once the correct base path is provided.

**Optional Requirements**

The optional requirement of creating a reusable framework for API integration was completed. This framework centralizes API requests and responses, making it easier to manage and scale.
